# Swift-Data-Structure-And-Algorithms

SwiftDSA is a collection of Data Structure and Algorithms in one Xcode project. It is meant to be used for illustration purposes from Computer Science perspective. The code written in Swift and uses full capability of the language (as much as I know about it indeed). It is a work in progress with more to be added so stay tuned.

## Code Structure

Every Data Structure implemented inside SwiftDSA should be placed inside the corresponding directory (i.e. Queue & Linked Lists are in Data Structure directory. Dijkestra Short Path is in Algorithms directory). Every Data Structure and/or Algorithm implemented should have corresponding Unit Tests along with a Visualization example on the screen (i.e. a View Controller that illustrates the concept).

## Protocol Oriented Programming

SwiftDSA code follows the POP concepts (Protocol Oriented Programming).

## Usage

SwiftDSA should be used as a simple reference to Data Structures and Algorithms

## Prerequisites

Highly recommend reading Advanced Swift and Functional Swift for understanding concepts found in SwiftDSA such as POP (Protocol Oriented Programming). The books can be found here https://www.objc.io/
